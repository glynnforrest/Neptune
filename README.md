# Neptune
### A PHP 5.3 application library
### By Glynn Forrest

Intro
-----
Neptune is a PHP library designed to take the pain out of PHP. It offers a
usable yet powerful set of loosely coupled components built to handle the common
problems a PHP developer encounters.

Neptune offers solutions to many of these: Database abstraction, data
validation, powerful routing, restful architectures, magic formatting,
usable views with powerful helpers and easy to use caching.

You better like PHP
-------------------
Being a PHP developer it is assumed you are comfortable with it. Neptune cuts the
cruft and offers one PHP-orientated solution for things like configuration and
templating. Configuration files are in pure PHP, allowing for powerful features such as
closures. Views are also in pure PHP - it is a language designed to be embedded in HTML!
If you're looking for a templating engine you've come to the wrong place.
Neptune isn't going to hold your hand. It is quick and to the point - just like it should be.

Documentation and support
-------------------------
Is currently a bit sparse. I aim to add useful commenting to the main classes
soon. I plan on recording some screencasts showing you some cool features and
you are welcome to email me, me@glynnforrest.com.

Warning
-------
Neptune is under heavy development so expect the code to change regularly.
Please upgrade carefully to avoid code breakage!

License
-------
Until I find one I'm happy with, you may do what the heck you like. A credit to
my name would be very nice. When I do find a license, I promise it will be very
open.

Have fun!
